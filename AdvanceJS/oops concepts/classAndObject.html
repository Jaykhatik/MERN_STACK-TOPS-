    🏗️ 1. What is a Class in JavaScript?
            ->A class is a blueprint or template used to create multiple objects that share similar properties and behaviors.
            ->It defines:
                ➤Properties (Variables) → Data about the object.
                ➤Methods (Functions) → Behavior or actions the object can perform.
                    💡 Classes were introduced in ES6 (2015) — before that, JS used prototypes to create objects.
                        🧩 Syntax of a Class:-
                            class ClassName {
                            constructor(parameters) {
                                // initialize object properties
                            }

                            method1() {
                                // behavior 1
                            }

                            method2() {
                                // behavior 2
                            }
                            }
            What is an Object?

                ->An object is an instance of a class — it represents a real-world entity created from the class template.
                ->Each object has its own copy of properties, but can share methods defined in the class.

                🏭 Example:
                    Class → "Car" (blueprint)
                    Object → "BMW", "Audi" (actual cars built from that blueprint)

                🧱 Example: Basic Class and Object:->-->
    <script>
        class Car {
            constructor(name, color) {
                this.name = name;   // property
                this.color = color; // property
            }

            start() {
                document.write(`${this.name} is starting...` + "<br>");
                document.write(`${this.color} BMW is Fabulous...` + "<br><br>");
            }

            stop() {
                document.write(`${this.name} has stopped.`+ "<br>");
                document.write(`${this.color} Audi is Average...` + "<br><br>");
            }
        }

        // Creating objects (instances)
        const car1 = new Car("BMW", "Black");
        const car2 = new Car("Audi", "White");

        // Accessing methods and properties
        car1.start();   // BMW is starting...
        car2.stop();    // Audi has stopped.
    </script>
