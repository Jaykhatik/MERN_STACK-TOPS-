    🧠 OOPs in JavaScript (From Basic to Advanced)
        ->JavaScript is prototype-based (not purely class-based like Java or C++),
        ->but ES6 introduced class syntax which makes it feel more like traditional OOP.


        🧩 What is OOP?

            ->Object-Oriented Programming is a way to structure your code using objects —
            ->which contain data (properties) and behavior (methods).

            ⚪Main goals:

                ➤Reusability (via inheritance)
                ➤Modularity
                ➤Scalability
                ➤Maintainability
