    🧠 What is Encapsulation in JavaScript (OOP)?
        🔹 Definition (in simple words):

            ->Encapsulation means binding (or grouping) data and methods together into one single unit (like a class)
            and protecting the data from being accessed or modified directly from outside the class.

            💬 Real-life Example

            Think of a TV remote 🎮
            ->You can use buttons like “Volume Up” or “Channel Down”
            ->But you cannot see or touch the internal circuits directly

            That’s Encapsulation —
            👉 you can use the functions (methods)
            but you can’t directly modify the internal working (data).
