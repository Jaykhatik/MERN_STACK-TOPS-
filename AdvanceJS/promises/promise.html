    ðŸ§© 1. What is a Promise in JavaScript?
           -> A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
           -> It acts as a placeholder for a value that is not yet known when the promise is created.
           ->syntax :-

           let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            // Async operation here
            let success = true;

            if (success) {
               resolve("Operation successful!");
            } else {
               reject("Something went wrong!");
            }
            });
