    <!-- 
    🔸 What are React Hooks?
        ->Hooks are special functions in React that allow you to use state and other React features without writing class components.
        ->Added in React 16.8, they allow functional components to become powerful and stateful.
    🔸 Why use Hooks?
        ->Simpler code: Hooks allow you to write cleaner and more concise code by using functions instead of classes.
        ->Reusability: You can create custom hooks to share logic between components.
        ->Easier to understand: Functional components with hooks are often easier to read and maintain.
    🔸 Commonly Used Hooks:
        1. useState: Manages state in functional components.
        2. useEffect: Handles side effects like data fetching and subscriptions.
        3. useContext: Accesses context values without prop drilling.
        4. useRef: Creates mutable references to DOM elements or values.
        5. useReducer: Manages complex state logic similar to Redux.
    🔸Additional Hooks:
        1. useMemo: Memoizes expensive calculations to optimize performance.
        2. useCallback: Memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
        3. useLayoutEffect: Similar to useEffect but runs synchronously after all DOM mutations.
        4. useImperativeHandle: Customizes the instance value that is exposed when using ref.
        5.useDebugValue: Displays a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.
        6.useDeferredValue: Defers updating a value to improve performance.
        7.useTransition: Manages concurrent UI updates.
        8.useId: Generates unique IDs for accessibility attributes.
        9.useSyncExternalStore: Subscribes to external stores for state synchronization.
        10.useInsertionEffect: Injects styles before DOM mutations.

    🔸 Creating Custom Hooks:
        ->You can create your own hooks to encapsulate reusable logic.
        ->Custom hooks are simply functions that use built-in hooks and follow the naming convention of starting with "use".
    🔸 Rules of Hooks:
        1. Only call hooks at the top level of your component or custom hook.
        2. Only call hooks from React functions (functional components or custom hooks).
