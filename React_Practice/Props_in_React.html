                                                ✯ THEORY

=============================================================================================================

        🌱 What are Props?
                ->Props (short for “Properties”) are used to pass data from one component to another.
                  Data flows from Parent → Child.
                ->Props make components dynamic and reusable
                ->Props are read-only (immutable)

        🌱Theory:-
            ⬤ Definition: 
                ->Props (short for properties) are a special keyword in React that 
                  represents the arguments passed into a component. They are essentially 
                  a JavaScript object that holds the data.
            ⬤ Data Flow: 
                ->Props facilitate a unidirectional (one-way) data flow, always 
                moving down the component hierarchy (from parent to child).
            ⬤ Immutability: 
                ->Props are read-only. A child component must not modify the 
                props it receives from its parent. This is a core concept that 
                keeps the UI predictable. If a component needs to change a value, it 
                should manage it internally using State.
            ⬤ Analogy: 
                ->Think of a component as a JavaScript function. The props are the 
                arguments you pass to that function.

                                            📜RULES OF PROPS

============================================================================================================
    

1. Read-Only (Immutable)
    ⬤ Rule: 
        ->Props are strictly read-only inside the child component. The child 
          component must not attempt to modify the props it receives.
    ⬤ Theory: 
        ->This immutability ensures a unidirectional data flow (parent-to-child), which 
          is key to React's predictable state management and makes debugging 
          easier. If a component needs to change a value, it should manage it as 
          its own state or call a function passed down as a prop from the parent 
          to update the parent's state.

2. Parent-to-Child Flow
    ⬤ Rule: 
        ->Data always flows down the component tree, from the parent to the child. A child 
        component cannot directly pass props up to its parent or across to a sibling component.

    ⬤ Theory: 
        ->This rigid hierarchy reinforces the unidirectional data flow. To communicate 
        up, the parent passes down a callback function as a prop, and the child calls that function.

3. Data Type Flexibility
    ⬤ Rule: Props can be any valid JavaScript data type, including:
            ->Primitives (strings, numbers, booleans)
            ->Objects and arrays
            ->Functions
            ->React elements (e.g., other components)

        | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
        | Props are immutable                         | Child component **cannot modify props**, only use them. |
        | Props are passed **from Parent to Child**   | Data flows downward only.                               |
        | Props allow component **reusability**       | Same component, different data.                         |
        | Can pass values, objects, arrays, functions | Props can be anything.                                  |

                                    💻 BASIC SYNTAX AND EXAMPLES

===========================================================================================================================
    
1. Passing Props (The Parent Component):
    ->You pass props to a child component just like you would add attributes to a standard 
      HTML tag. You can pass any JavaScript data type, including strings, numbers, 
      objects, arrays, and functions.
    ->Syntax:

        <ChildComponent propName={value} anotherProp="StringValue" />

    ->Example (Parent Component):

        // ParentComponent.js
            import React from 'react';
            import Greeting from './Greeting';

            function App() {
            const userName = "Alex";
            const userAge = 30;

            return (
                <div>
                <Greeting 
                    name={userName} 
                    age={userAge} 
                    isLoggedIn={true}
                />
                </div>
            );
            }

            export default App;


2. Receiving and Using Props (The Child Component)
    ->In a functional component, props are received as the first argument to the function.
    ->Syntax:
                function ChildComponent(props) {
                    // Use props.propName
                }
    ->Example (Functional Child Component):
        // Greeting.js
            import React from 'react';

            function Greeting(props) {
            // Accessing props using dot notation
            return (
                <div>
                <h2>Hello, {props.name}!</h2>
                <p>You are {props.age} years old.</p>
                {props.isLoggedIn && <p>Status: Logged In</p>}
                </div>
            );
            }

            export default Greeting;
