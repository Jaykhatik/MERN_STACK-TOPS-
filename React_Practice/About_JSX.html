    <!-- 
    🌱 What is JSX?
        👉 JSX is stand for JavaScript XML(Extensible Markup Language)
        👉 JSX allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript.
        👉 It is used inside React to build UI elements.
        Example:
                const element = <h1>Hello React</h1>;

                ⬤ Looks like HTML, but is actually JavaScript behind the scenes.
                ⬤ Makes React code easy to write, easy to understand, and maintainable.



    ====================================================================================================

    📝 Essential Rules of JSX in React
        ->JSX (JavaScript XML) has a strict set of rules that distinguish it from standard HTML. Adhering to these rules is crucial for writing valid React code.

     1. Single Root Element:

            ->Every JSX block must return a single root element. You cannot 
              have two top-level elements adjacent to each other.

            ❌ Incorrect:
                    return (
                        <h1>Title</h1>
                        <p>Content</p>
                        );

            ✅ Correct (Using a <div>):
                    return (
                    <div>
                        <h1>Title</h1>
                        <p>Content</p>
                    </div>
                    );

            ->Use the shorthand Fragment syntax (<>...</>) to group elements 
              without adding an extra node to the DOM.

                    return (
                        <>
                            <h1>Title</h1>
                            <p>Content</p>
                        </>
                        );


    2. Case and Naming Conventions

        ⬤ HTML Tags vs. Components
            HTML Tags (lowercase): 
            Standard HTML tags must be written in lowercase (e.g., <div>, <span>, <img>).

            Custom Components (Capitalized): 
            React custom components must start with a capital letter (e.g., <MyComponent>, <UserProfile>). React treats lowercase tags as standard HTML/SVG elements.

        ⬤ Attribute Naming
            ->Attributes are written in camelCase, following JavaScript conventions, not kebab-case (like in HTML).

                👉class becomes className: 
                    ->This is the most common difference, as class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
                👉for becomes htmlFor: 
                    ->Used for associating labels with form elements.
                👉onclick becomes onClick.
                👉tabindex becomes tabIndex.

    

    3. Closing Tags
            ->All tags must be explicitly closed. This applies to both parent tags and self-closing tags.
            
            ❌ Incorrect (Self-closing tags):
                    <img src="path/to/image.jpg">
                    <br>

            ✅ Correct (Self-closing tags): Self-closing tags must end with a forward slash (/).
                    <img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description" />
                    <br />

            ✅ Correct (Paired tags): Standard tags must have an opening and a closing pair.
                    <button>Click Me</button>


    4. Embedding JavaScript Expressions
            ->You can embed any valid JavaScript expression inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces ({}).

            ⬤ Expressions Only: 
                    ->You can use variables, function calls, arithmetic operations, and object properties.
            ⬤ No Statements: 
                    ->You cannot use JavaScript statements like if...else blocks or for loops directly inside JSX. You must use 
                      ternary operators, logical operators, or map functions instead.


                    const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };
                    const isLoggedIn = true;

                    return (
                    <div>
                        {/* Embedding a variable */}
                        <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>

                        {/* Embedding an arithmetic operation */}
                        <p>The total is: {5 + 3}</p>

                        {/* Embedding a conditional expression (Ternary Operator) */}
                        <p>Status: {isLoggedIn ? 'Logged In' : 'Logged Out'}</p>
                    </div>
                    );
